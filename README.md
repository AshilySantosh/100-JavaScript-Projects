# ðŸ’¯ 100 JavaScript Projects Challenge

I'm doing the 100 JavaScript Projects Challenge inspired by [100jsprojects.com](https://100jsprojects.com) to strengthen my frontend skills using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript ðŸš€

This repo contains all the projects I build during the challenge â€” from beginner to advanced!
